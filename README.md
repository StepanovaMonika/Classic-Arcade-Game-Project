# Classic Arcade Game Project

This project is part of Udacity's FEND and is based on a classic arcade game Frogger.

## How to play the game

The player's goal is to reach the water. The player can use top, bottom, right, and left arrow keys to move the character. He must avoid collisions with enemies (bugs). The enemies can only move on the brick tiles. 

Every time the player reaches the water, he scores 1 point. If the player collides with an enemy, the score is reset and the character moves back to the start. 

The game is won when the player scores 15 points.

## How to run the game

The game can be played directly in a <a href="https://stepanovamonika.github.io/Classic-Arcade-Game-Project/">browser</a>. 
You can also download the files, unzip them and open index.html.
